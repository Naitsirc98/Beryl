/*
The BRDF, or bidirectional reflective distribution function is a function that takes as input the incoming
(light) direction w_i, the outgoing (view) direction w_o, the surface normal n and a surface parameter a that
represents the microsurfaceâ€™s roughness. The BRDF approximates how much each individual light ray w_i
contributes to the final reflected light of an opaque surface given its material properties.
